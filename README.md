## Tailwind CSS Integration

This project includes [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. It is already configured with `postcss` and `autoprefixer`. To make changes to the design, modify the `tailwind.config.js` file.

Tailwind is applied to all components using utility-first CSS, allowing for rapid UI development.

## Framer Motion

Framer Motion is used for animations. You can easily add animations to your components by importing `motion` from `framer-motion` and wrapping your components.

Example:

```jsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";

const Component = () => (
	<motion.div
		initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
		animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
		transition={{ duration: 1 }}
	>
		Hello, World!
	</motion.div>
);
```

The ESLint configuration is located in `.eslintrc` and helps maintain code quality. Ensure to run the linter before pushing changes:

npm run lint
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn lint
```
